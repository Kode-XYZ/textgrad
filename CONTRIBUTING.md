Hello! We are excited about you wanting to help us in making TextGrad great!

## Before getting started

First of all, we would like to thank all contributors for their interest in the project.
You can find a list of contributors in the README file. We would love for you to be part of it!

Contributing is much easier than you think.

# How to contribute

If you need further guidance, you can open an issue, write in the discussion section 

Please note we have a [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Getting started

While we have not yet a set of concrete guidelines, we have some initial issues that might be a good starting point.

* Caches are a general class, but every engine has to implement the same 4 lines of code to greate the key, and check if the object is in the cache. This could be generalized in a base class.
* The way we now store cache names is brittle, users can easily confuse caches. Also, it is not clear that the model_string is actually the one used for the caching.
* Writing docs for the notebooks. Currently, the notebooks are not documented at all.

## Coding conventions

We currently have not settled on a coding convention. We are open to suggestions and will update this section as soon as we have a decision.

## Code of Conduct

Please consider that similarly to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless 
of _age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation._
